# ChirpNet Project

ChirpNet is a simple, single-page social media website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX front-end with Node and Express for the back-end. It allows users to share their thoughts and ideas by posting messages called ‘chirps’.

This project was initially named 'TweetNet' but has now been renamed ChirpNet. The GET/POST requests and variable names are called 'tweets' but are not referred to as such, in the aims of making it more personal and original.
